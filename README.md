# cedfreader
C(++) front end to convert EDF files to C++ structs-of-vectors. Main purpose is to convert samples/events to CSV files.

Mostly copied verbatim from the eyelinkReader (https://github.com/alexander-pastukhov/eyelinkReader) for quickly demonstrating a bug to the maker of eyelink and the EDFAPI.

Quickly modified to remove references to R structs and functions.
